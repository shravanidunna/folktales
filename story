For several generations, stories from Africa have traditionally been passed down by word of mouth. 
Often, after a hard dayâ€™s work, the adults would gather the children together by moonlight, 
around a village fire and tell stories. This was traditionally called 'Tales by Moonlight'.
Usually, the stories are meant to prepare young people for life, and so each story taught a lesson or moral.
